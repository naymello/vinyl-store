## What is it?

**vinylStore** is an app that mimics a store selling vinyl.
It has three screens:

- **Vinyl Selection** or the main screen, where you can select the vinyl you want to buy;
- **Vinyl Details**, where you can see the details of the vinyl you chose, including author, genres, the year the vinyl was released and, of course, its price;
- **Bag**, where you can see the chosen vinyl and the total price of these. You can also select each vinyl how many times you wish.
